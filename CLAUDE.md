# Claude Development Notes

This file contains development notes and instructions for Claude Code.

## Project Overview
- Project: clalit-rapid-chat
- Repository: /home/amitkinor/development/clalit-rapid-chat
i am building a chat user interface (i.e. ui) for a medical company.

the ui should be responsive in order to run clearly on a cell phone or a desktop monitor
it need the ui to be based on a theme that i can edit if needed, the visual assets and guidelines will be added 
the visual assets will be comprised of logos, icon, colors etc
until i will add the visual assets i need the main color to be white blue and green
## Development Commands
the project should be written in typescript
it should be separated between the client and a mock server that returns a line of text.

## Notes
the chat should be "clean" without visual "noise"
